## About: 

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree, minus general education.

For this script I'm following the same curriculum as [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), with some differences, but the purpose of this repository is to make my certificates available along with the projects developed.
