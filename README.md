## About: 

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree, minus general education.

For this script I'm following the same curriculum as [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), with some differences, but the purpose of this repository is to make my certificates available along with the projects developed.

### Important Notes:

In addition to this computer science roadmap, I also have a curriculum for Data Science, which is my main focus.

### References.

To build this curriculum, I used these sources:

- [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) - Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science.
- [Open Source Computer Science](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs) - The Open Source Computer Science Degree.
